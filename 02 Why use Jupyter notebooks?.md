## Why use Jupyter Notebooks?

Even if you think you don't use computational methods, if you use programs like Excel or 
- Learn how to code and experiment with data processing
- Interactive, provides immediate feedback, work in code blocks (not whole scripts)    
- Learn from othersâ€™ efforts and understand their data and research processes    
- Explore and extract data from large datasets without having to download them
- Test out calculations and visualisations that highlight important data points


### What are Jupyter Notebooks used for?

Notebooks are being used in an ever-increasing number of domains, by a large range of researchers. Currently the main fields using Jupyter Notebooks are the following: 

- Programming and Computer Science
- Statistics, Machine Learning and Data Science
- Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology
- Earth Science and Geo-Spatial data
- Linguistics and Text Mining
- Signal Processing
- Engineering Education

### Activity

More humanities researchers are adopting Jupyter Notebooks as part of their research practice. Take a look at the following and discuss how Jupyter Notebooks might be useful in different fields:
