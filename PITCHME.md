@title[Notebook Function]
### What do Jupyter Notebooks do? 

Keypoints: Notebooks may or may not be useful for researchers! But if they are, they could accelerate research or just improve a few processes to make life less tedious. :)

Note:
Objectives: Understand what notebooks are capable of
Activity: How could you see a notebook being useful to researchers?

@title[Notebook Overview]
## Overview

Jupyter Notebooks offer a hybrid environment in which you can perform computational tasks while also using text to annotate or describe what you and your code blocks are doing. It's a like a mix between the command line and a word processor. 

### What can Jupyter Notebooks do?

>“The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.”
