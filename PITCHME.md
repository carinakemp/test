<p style="color:gray">For Research Support Specialists</p>
<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">C3DIS 2019</p> 


Note: 
A first look at notebooks, why they are useful and how to use them. Then some time working with a notebook.

@title[Agenda]
### Agenda 
- What is a Jupyter notebook and how does it function. 30 mins
- Where does a Jupyter notebook fit in different researcher toolkits. 45 mins
- Why use Jupyter notebook on a desktop and why use it in the cloud. 30 mins
- Basic Python programming using a Jupyter notebook. 30 mins
- Wrap up. 10 mins

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">\*workshop is ~3 hours including breaks </p> 


Note:  
If we have time, we can have a go at using R too, with some basic commands.

@title[Notebook Function]
### What do Jupyter Notebooks do? 

- Notebooks may or may not be useful for researchers! 
- But if they are, they could accelerate research or just improve a few processes to make life less tedious. :)

Note:
- Objective: Understand what notebooks are capable of. 
- Activity: How could you see a notebook being useful to researchers?

@title[Notebook Description]
### Overview

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">Jupyter Notebooks offer a hybrid environment in which you can perform computational tasks while also using text to annotate or describe what you and your code blocks are doing. It is like a mix between working in a command line interface, writing arguments in a programming language, and working in a word processor application, writing up documentation.</p>

@title[Notebook Overview]
### What can Jupyter Notebooks do?

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">“The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.”</p>

–description from [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

@title[Data Cleaning]
#### [Data cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing)

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">Data cleaning is about finding and correcting (or removing) inaccuracies from a dataset, a table, or a database. The process involves identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting them.</p>

Note:
In Jupyter Notebooks you can preview and analyse a limited number of columns and rows of data at a time, so you can see if there are blanks or repeated errors or inaccuracies. In addition, working directly with a large dataset without having to download it can save a lot of time.

@title[Data Transformation]
#### Data transformation

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">Data transformation is the process of converting data values from one source format or structure to another so they become consistent or intelligbible to a target structure or system. A typical scenario where information needs to be shared involves the extraction of the data from the source application or data custodian, the transformation of that data into another format, and finally loading the transformed data into the target location.</p>

@title[Numerical Simulation]
#### Numerical Simulation
Simulation can be used to trace waves e.g. seismic or shock waves.

@title[Statistical Modelling]
#### Statistical Modelling
Linear regression: is a type of statistical model used to reveal a relationship between two variables.

@title[Data Visualisation]
#### Data Visualisation
Network analysis: is a form of data visualisation of nodes of different sizes connected in a network.

@title[Programming Languages]
### Programming Languages

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with a variety of different programming languages. Initially the notebookes were for *Julia*, *Python* and *R* but now they support many more languages. 

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">If you don't know the languages and packages researchers use, it might be helpful to think about the types of tasks they want to perform. Python is currently the most popular language used in Jupyter Notebooks as well as R, you can also consider what is commonly used in different fields of research.</p>

Note:
- Objective: Understand languages (and packages) that are suited to different research tasks. 
- Activity: In pairs, talk about which programming language might make the most sense for you and why. When you are ready, think about how you would recommend Python or R to someone else in your field. Share this with the group.

@title[Technical Breakdown]
### Technical Breakdown

- Used to capture documentation and executable code 
- An editable document with input and output “cells” (text strings) 
- Document files comprised of JSON > *yourfilenam.ipynb*

Note: 
Human-readable documents containing: analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) and executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

@title[Notebook Operation]
### Notebook Operation

- Editable and viewable in a web browser
- Can run on local machine with no internet
- Can run on remote machine with internet
