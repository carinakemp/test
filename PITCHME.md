Note:
A first look at notebooks, why they are useful and how to use them. Then some time working with a notebook.

### Agenda 
- What is a Jupyter notebook and how does it function. 30 mins
- Where does a Jupyter notebook fit in different researcher toolkits. 45 mins
- Why use Jupyter notebook on a desktop and why use it in the cloud. 30 mins
- Basic Python programming using a Jupyter notebook. 30 mins
- Wrap up. 10 mins

### What do Jupyter Notebooks do? 

- Notebooks may or may not be useful for researchers! 
- But if they are, they could accelerate research or just improve a few processes to make life less tedious. :)

Note:
- Objectives: Understand what notebooks are capable of. 
- Activity: How could you see a notebook being useful to researchers?

### Overview

Jupyter Notebooks offer a hybrid environment in which you can perform computational tasks while also using text to annotate or describe what you and your code blocks are doing. It's a like a mix between the command line and a word processor.

### What can Jupyter Notebooks do?

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">>“The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.”</p>

### Programming Languages

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with a variety of different programming languages. Initially the notebookes were for Julia, Python and R but now they support many more languages. 

Note:
If you don't know the languages researchers use, it might be helpful to think about the types of tasks they want to perform. Python is currently the most popular language used in Jupyter Notebooks as well as R, you can also consider what is commonly used in different fields of research.
