## Ready to splash a little with Python?

Using the workshop list of commands - saved in the repository as **Worksheet_Python.txt** we can now start with some basic coding.

- First let's start with some basic maths.
  - In a new cell, select 'code'. Remember that the code cell looks different to the markdown cell. How can you tell?
  - Type **list(range(1, 20))** 
  - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut **Shift+Enter** to execute the cell. 
  - You have created a list of the range of numbers from 1 to 20. Woohoo!
  
  
  - In the next cell type the following:
  
  **a = list(range(1, 20))**

  - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut **Shift+Enter** to execute the cell.
  - This cell tells the computer that the list of numbers you created can now be called 'a'. This is called a 'value'.  
  
   	**x = sum(a)**
	**print(x)** This time you have performed a 'sequence'. This is a list of instructions to be carried out in order.  The second instruction tells the computer to add each of those numbers in the list ('a') together and give that total a value of 'x'. The last instruction tells the computer to print the total on the screen.
   
   You just did some computing! Hooray!
 
## Mini-activity

Take a few minutes to change the range of numbers, and/or change the values and see what happens. Have a bit of fun with it - see if you can beat the computer with your amazing arithmetic skills. Or just be amazed at how fast it can be. 
 
Now let's try italics. In a new cell type **_this is a string_**, and select 'Markdown' from the dropdown menu again.
  - Click on 'Run' or use the  shortcut **Shift+Enter** to execute the cell.
  - Voila! _Italics!_

### Mini-activity

Following the same instructions as above, try typing these: 

  -**print ("this is a string")**
    
  -**print ("\"this is a string\"")**
    
What happens? What is going on here? Speak in small groups about these instructions, markdown and what you've just learned. It can feel a little strange, as you already know how to do this in programs like Word, but what we are doing here is shorthand, and 'speaking' directly to the computer, with a different kind of interface.
