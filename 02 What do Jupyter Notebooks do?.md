## Overview

Jupyter Notebooks offer a hybrid environment in which you can perform computational tasks while also using text to annotate or describe what you and your code blocks are doing. It's a like a mix between the command line and a word processor. 

### What can Jupyter Notebooks do?

>“The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.”

–description from [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

#### [Data cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing)

Data cleaning is about finding and correcting (or removing) inaccuracies from a dataset, a table, or a database. The process involves identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting them.

In Jupyter Notebooks you can preview and analyse a limited number of columns and rows of data at a time, so you can see if there are blanks or repeated errors or inaccuracies. In addition, working directly with a large dataset without having to download it can save a lot of time.

### A Word on Languages  (teehee)

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with a variety of different programming languages. Initially they were for Julia, Python and R but now they support many more. If you don't know any languages, it might be helpful to think about the types of tasks you want to perform. Python is currently the most popular language used in Jupyter Notebooks but you should also consider what is commonly used in your field.

### Activity

In pairs, talk about which programming language might make the most sense for you and why. When you are ready, think about how you would recommend Python or R to someone else in your field. Share this with the group.
