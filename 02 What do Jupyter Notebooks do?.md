## Overview

Jupyter Notebooks offer a hybrid environment in which you can perform computational tasks while also using text to annotate or describe what you and your code blocks are doing. It's a like a mix between the command line and a word processor. 

### What can Jupyter Notebooks do?

>“The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.”

–description from [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

Flexibility to test out ideas matched with jumping between cells in the notebook 
“Working state” can be altered and make it difficult to reproduce results 
Works with version control software e.g. GitHub 
Not great for production code development (IDE) 
Can share them with those that don’t have the notebook installed e.g. GitHub or Nbviewer

Use for: testing a specific block of code, not the whole script 
More interactive than IDE, code display aids learning, interpretation, collaboration, understanding 
REPL - read evaluation print loop 
Instant feedback and ability to share easily 
Graphical rendering markdown and plots inline 

### Languages

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with a variety of different programming languages. Initially they were for Julia, Python and R but now they support many more. If you don't know any languages, it might be helpful to think about the types of tasks you want to perform. Python is currently the most popular language used in Jupyter Notebooks but you should also consider what is commonly used in your field.

### Activity

In pairs, talk about which programming language might make the most sense for you and why. When you are ready, think about how you would recommend Python or R to someone else in your field. Share this with the group.
