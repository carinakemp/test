Flexibility to test out ideas matched with jumping between cells in the notebook 
“Working state” can be altered and make it difficult to reproduce results 
Works with version control software e.g. GitHub 
Not great for production code development (IDE) 
Can share them with those that don’t have the notebook installed e.g. GitHub or Nbviewer

Use for: testing a specific block of code, not the whole script 
More interactive than IDE, code display aids learning, interpretation, collaboration, understanding 
REPL - read evaluation print loop 
Instant feedback and ability to share easily 
Graphical rendering markdown and plots inline
