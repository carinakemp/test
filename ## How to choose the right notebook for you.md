FYI. How to choose the right notebook for you. 

"In this post, I'm going to review six services you can use to easily run your Jupyter notebook in the cloud. All of them have the following characteristics: 
•	They don't require you to install anything on your local machine.
•	They are completely free (or they have a free plan).
•	They give you access to the Jupyter Notebook environment (or a Jupyter-like environment).
•	They allow you to import and export notebooks using the standard .ipynb file format.
•	They support the Python language (and most support other languages as well).
Since all of these are cloud-based services, none of them will work for you if you are restricted to working with your data on-premise."
