## Getting started

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get started with Jupyter Notebooks using Python:

1. Open up MyBinder: (https://mybinder.org/)
2. Paste the link to this GitHub repository (https://github.com/ingridbmason/Intro-to-Jupyter/) and click on LAUNCH.
3. Open workshop list of commands in separate window: (https://github.com/ingridbmason/Intro-to-Jupyter/blob/master/Worksheet_Python.txt)
4. Open a new notebook from the top righthand dropdown menu: Click on 'New' and then select Python 3.

5. Select 'File' at the top left hand side of the screen and select 'Save As'. Name your notebook 'Intro to Jupyter Notebooks'.

## Let's go for dip with Python

Using the workshop list of commands - saved in the repository as **Worksheet_Python.txt** we can now start with some basic markdown. Remember that [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is how you can make rich (or formatted) text in a plain text editor.

- Let's work in markdown!
  - In computer programming a 'string' is sequence of alphanumerical characters
  - Type **# this is a string** into the cell, making sure you select 'Markdown' from the dropdown menu above where it shows 'Code' as the default. Already here you can see how notebooks are flexible, as you can choose what kind of cell you are writing in (and toggle it at any time!)

 - Click on 'Run' or use the shortcut **Shift+Enter** to execute the cell. 
 - You have just created a heading in your notebook! Hooray!
